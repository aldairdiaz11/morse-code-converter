## Text to Morse Code Converter

You will use what you've learnt to create a text-based (command line) program that takes any String input and converts
it into Morse Code.\
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code">Wikipedia Entry for Morse Code</a>

Example of use:

When you run the program, you see the following messages in the CLI:\
`Welcome to the text to Morse converter`\
`Enter a word or click enter to exit:`

You have to enter a text to be converter to Morse code, like so:\
`Python is great!`\
And the program will return the morse code:\
`.--. -.-- - .... --- -. / .. ... / --. .-. . .- -`

This will continue until you hit enter.
